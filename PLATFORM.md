**Existing Flow (Phase 1)**:
1. Creator Signup âœ…
2. Game Project Creation âœ…
3. Rulebook Editing âœ…
4. Basic Collaboration ðŸš§
5. [Future: Asset Integration]
6. [Future: Marketplace Publishing]

**Critical Gaps**:
- Limited collaboration features
- No asset management system
- No revenue sharing mechanism
- No marketplace functionality

## Strategic Framework for Feature Prioritization

### 1. User Journey Strengthening
Priority: **Strengthen weakest links in the creator journey**
- Current weak points: Collaboration features, asset integration

### 2. Network Effects Multiplier
Priority: **Features that increase creator-to-creator interactions**
- Cross-project collaboration tools
- Asset sharing and remixing
- Creator discovery and connection

### 3. Marketplace Readiness
Priority: **Revenue-enabling capabilities**
- Digital asset management
- Usage rights and licensing
- Payment processing foundation

### 4. Creator Retention
Priority: **Features that keep creators engaged**
- Collaboration tools
- Revenue sharing transparency
- Portfolio and reputation building

## Decision Framework

For each feature request, evaluate:

1. **Journey Impact**: Does this strengthen a weak link in the creator journey?
2. **Network Effects**: Does this increase creator-to-creator interactions?
3. **Revenue Enablement**: Does this support the revenue sharing mechanism?
4. **Technical Foundation**: Is this required for future features?
5. **Competitive Advantage**: Does this leverage our collaborative differentiation?

### Effort Classification
- **Small**: < 1 week implementation
- **Medium**: 1-4 weeks implementation
- **Large**: > 4 weeks implementation

### Priority Matrix
- **High**: Critical for current phase completion or enables next phase
- **Medium**: Valuable but not blocking progress
- **Low**: Nice-to-have, can be deferred

## Current Development Context

**Tech Stack**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Supabase, TipTap, ShadCN/UI, Tailwind CSS
**Team**: Single developer
**Focus**: Completing Phase 1 before expanding to multi-creator workflows

**Key Architectural Decisions Needed**:
- Content reusability system design
- Asset management architecture
- Collaboration real-time features
- Revenue tracking infrastructure

## Success Metrics by Phase

**Phase 1 Success**:
- Complete rulebook creation workflow
- Basic project management
- User onboarding completion rate >70%

**Phase 2-3 Success**:
- Multi-creator project adoption
- Asset upload and usage rates
- Creator cross-pollination metrics

**Phase 4-5 Success**:
