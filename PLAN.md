- **For Contributors**: Join exciting projects, build portfolio, earn compensation through flexible arrangements
- **For Fans**: Support projects from inception, receive exclusive content, and influence development
- **For Industry**: Democratize game development and discover new talent

### Technical Philosophy
- **JSX + TypeScript** - Clean, readable components with full type safety
- **No Virtual DOM** - Direct DOM manipulation for maximum performance
- **Minimal Dependencies** - Only what you absolutely need, nothing more
- **Local-First Development** - Full offline development capability

## 2. How Budget Zero Works

## 5. Technical Architecture

### JSX Component System

**Component Structure**
```tsx
// src/components/Button.tsx
interface ButtonProps {
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'success' | 'warning' | 'error'
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'
  disabled?: boolean
  onClick?: () => void
  children: string
}

export function Button({ 
  variant = 'primary', 
  size = 'md', 
  disabled = false, 
  onClick, 
  children 
}: ButtonProps) {
  const button = (
    <button 
      class={`btn btn--${variant} btn--${size}`}
      disabled={disabled}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  ) as HTMLButtonElement
  
  if (onClick) {
    button.addEventListener('click', onClick)
  }
  
  return button
}
```

**App Architecture**
```tsx
// src/main.tsx
import { LandingPage } from './components/LandingPage'
import { AuthPage } from './components/AuthPage'
import { DashboardPage } from './components/DashboardPage'

const app = {
  currentView: 'landing' as 'landing' | 'auth' | 'dashboard',
  
  render() {
    const container = document.getElementById('app')
    if (!container) return
    
    container.innerHTML = ''
    
    let viewElement: HTMLElement
    switch (this.currentView) {
      case 'landing':
        viewElement = <LandingPage />
        break
      case 'auth':
        viewElement = <AuthPage />
        break
      case 'dashboard':
        viewElement = <DashboardPage />
        break
      default:
        viewElement = <LandingPage />
    }
    
    container.appendChild(viewElement)
  }
}
```

### State Management

**Simple App State**
```tsx
const appState = {
  user: null as User | null,
  currentProject: null as Project | null,
  
  setUser(user: User | null) {
    this.user = user
    localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user))
    this.render()
  },
  
  setCurrentProject(project: Project | null) {
    this.currentProject = project
    this.render()
  },
  
  loadState() {
    const user = localStorage.getItem('user')
    if (user) {
      this.user = JSON.parse(user)
    }
  }
}
```

### Routing System

**Simple View Switching**
```tsx
const router = {
  currentRoute: 'landing',
  
  navigate(route: string) {
    this.currentRoute = route
    window.history.pushState({ route }, '', `/${route}`)
    app.render()
  },
  
  handlePopState(event: PopStateEvent) {
    if (event.state?.route) {
      this.currentRoute = event.state.route
      app.render()
    }
  }
}

window.addEventListener('popstate', (event) => {
  router.handlePopState(event)
})
```

### CSS Architecture

**Design Tokens**
```css
/* src/styles/app.css */
:root {
  /* Colors */
  --color-primary: #2563eb;
  --color-secondary: #64748b;
  --color-success: #059669;
  --color-warning: #d97706;
  --color-error: #dc2626;
  
  /* Typography */
  --font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif;
  --font-size-base: 1rem;
  --font-size-lg: 1.125rem;
  --font-size-xl: 1.25rem;
  
  /* Spacing */
  --space-4: 1rem;
  --space-6: 1.5rem;
  --space-8: 2rem;
}

/* Component styles */
.btn {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 0.75rem 1.5rem;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 6px;
  font-size: var(--font-size-base);
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: all 0.2s ease;
}

.btn--primary {
  background: var(--color-primary);
  color: white;
}

.btn--primary:hover {
  background: #1d4ed8;
  transform: translateY(-1px);
}
```

### Data Storage

**Local-First Approach**
- **localStorage** for user preferences and session data
- **IndexedDB** for larger data sets (projects, assets)
- **File System API** for local file management
- **WebSQL** for complex queries (when needed)

**Data Portability**
- **Export/Import** - Complete data export in JSON format
- **Webhook System** - Real-time data sync with external platforms
- **API Access** - RESTful API for third-party integrations
- **Migration Tools** - Easy data transfer between platforms
